# Security Policy

The security of this application is a top priority. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you may find.

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to addressing security issues in a timely and responsible manner. If you discover a security vulnerability, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us privately.

To report a vulnerability, please use one of the following methods:

1.  **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**: If this feature is enabled for the repository, please use it to submit your report. This is the most secure and preferred method.
2.  **Create a Confidential Issue**: If private vulnerability reporting is not available, please create an issue on our GitHub repository. Please provide a clear and descriptive title, such as "Security Vulnerability: [Brief Description]", and include as much detail as possible in the issue description. If you have the option to make the issue confidential, please do so.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes, if you have them.

We will make our best effort to respond to your report promptly, acknowledge the issue, and keep you updated on our progress toward a fix. We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure.
