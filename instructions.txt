write in golang an efficient hash generation program that can process in parallel the result of a recursive search for files in a folder. The file pattern, name of the directory and type of hash will be 3 command line parameters. If the file pattern option is omitted, all files are searched. if the name of directory is omitted, the current directory is searched. if hash type is ommitted, MD5 is default. file pattern command line value will be passed as --file-pattern=, directory name value will be passed as --path=, type of hash as --hash=. Hash can be: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, XXHASH, BLAKE3. The results can be stored in a file if --out-file is specified, or each file can be renamed to their hash value if --rename is specified. If --display is specified, the value of the hash is displayed to the user. for efficiency, the operations of file ouput, rename and display will be done outside of the search loop.
